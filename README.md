# G.E.C.K.O.

The G.E.C.K.O. project is a skillsystem for the open-source voice assistant [Rhasspy](https://rhasspy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).  
It offers the possibility to install and manage functions in a modular way.  
This is the main repository of the project and together with the [project website](https://gecko-voice-assistant.github.io/gecko/) it is the first point of contact for new users.  
We would be very happy if you would visit our [Discord](https://discord.gg/W74jwuXGhg).
