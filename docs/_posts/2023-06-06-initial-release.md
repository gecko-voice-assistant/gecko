title:  "Version 0.0.0 was released!"
---

We have released the initial version of the G.E.C.K.O. skillsystem.  
It has the version number 0.0.0 and marks the official start of this project.  
If you want to know how to install the service, follow these [instructions](../_docs/installation.md).  
This version is currently the simplest version and is by no means final.  
Skills can already be downloaded, installed and tested, but there are hardly any skills available yet.  
So if you feel like creating new skills, check out this [guide](../_docs/create-skill/instruction.md)!
If you just wann hang out with us, make sure to join our [Discord](../_docs/join.md#channels).
  
Happy testing!  
And thank you for being here!
