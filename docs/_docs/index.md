Welcome to the G.E.C.K.O. project!

Here we are developing a skills system for the open-source voice assistant [Rhasspy](https://rhasspy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

To learn how to use it, check out our [installation guide](./installation.md).

If you want to join the community, you can do so [here](./join.md).

If you want to develop your own skills for the system, read the appropriate [chapter](./create-skill/instruction.md).
