Welcome to the G.E.C.K.O. project!

Here we are developing a skillsystem for the open-source voice assistant [Rhasspy](https://rhasspy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).  
It is based on a proof-of-concept, which was developed in the course of a [study project](https://fwehn.github.io/pp-voiceassistant/).  
If you are curious to try this system yourself, check out the [installation guide](./installation.md).  
To join the community you can see the channels we use [here](./join.md).  
This project lives solely from community members creating contributions.  
If you also want to improve the project, see [here](./contributing/how-to.md) how to do it.  
In addition to the skill system itself, new skills must always be developed. 
For this purpose, we have created a [guide](./create-skill/instruction.md) on how to create them.
