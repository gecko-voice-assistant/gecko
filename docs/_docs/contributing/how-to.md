# How to file an Issue?

If you found a bug or you are missing a feature, please file an issue in GitHub.  
Consider to which component of the project the issue belongs and create it in the corresponding project.  
If you don't know what it belongs to, put it in the [main repository](https://github.com/gecko-voice-assistant/gecko/issues).  

If your issue is an error, please include the following information:
- The platform on which the problem occurred.
- The version of the skill manager and frontend currently in use.
- The complete error message issued by the respective component. 
- A short summary of how the error occurred.

# How to make a code contribution?

You should only create a code contribution if there is an associated issue.  
If there is an issue, please fork the appropriate repository and work locally on your changes.  
If all changes work locally and the system is not damaged, you have to let [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) check and format your code first.  
There are scripts for this in the respective ``package.json``.  
If there are any errors, fix them before committing your code.  
After that you can create a commit and push it to your own repository.  
From there you can create a pull request.  
Please make sure to specify the corresponding issue in the pull request.
