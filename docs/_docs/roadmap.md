title: Roadmap
permalink: /docs/roadmap/

Since this project is based on a proof-of-concept, which was developed in the course of a [study project](https://fwehn.github.io/pp-voiceassistant/), all functions of the existing system have to be transferred to this project in the first release.  
These functions will then be expanded in subsequent releases.  
Here is a small roadmap for the course of this year.

| All functions implemented in the study project should have been transferred and improved if necessary. | Different installation options should be offered (e.g. Docker and Raspberry Pi disk image).                                                     | The dynamic slots should be revised so that they are registered within the skill code.        | An instance should be accessible, through which the revised skills can be retrieved.                                | The skills from the study project should be revised to be compatible with the new system. |
