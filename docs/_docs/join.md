We are looking for you!  
For this project to be successful, we need all the help we can get.  
It is already a huge help to us if you join the community and participate in discussions or polls.  
If you want to do more look at how to [create contributions](./contributing/how-to.md) for the project.  
However, before you join our community, you should read our [Code of Conduct](./code_of_conduct.md).  
If you fail to do so, we will be forced to exclude you from our communication channels.

## Channels

Currently, our communication channels are limited to our Discord server.  
It is possible that you run other social media platforms or channels on behalf of the G.E.C.K.O. project.  
To do so, contact our maintainers on [Discord](https://discord.gg/W74jwuXGhg).
